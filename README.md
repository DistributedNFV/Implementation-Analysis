# Abstract
A majority of communication service providers are using Network Function Virtualization (NFV) currently as a method to accelerate service delivery and reduce associated overhead and costs at the same time. Ease of deployment, vendor independence and cost reduction are some of the factors that NFV addresses. While distributed systems have for long been used to provide decentralized operation, through this paper we propose a system to integrate NFV and distributed systems, so that the advantages of either system can be enhanced upon with the other. We focus mainly on the customer edge and the distributed cloud. Evaluations for the system are primarily on the latency and round trip time measured by comparing with a centralized system where all the functions are present in the cloud verses functions being distributed over the entire architecture.
